  <h1>Photographs:</h1>
  <p>This picture was taken of my nephew Nathan when he was playing on the porch of my grandma's house in Colorado.</p>
  <p><img src="BigNate.JPG" width="700" height="500" alt=""/></p>
  <p>This picture was taken on a walk in the park in my hometown of Avon, Colorado. The only edits I made to this photo was turning it black and white.</p>
  <img src="BranchesClouds.JPG" width="700" height="500" alt=""/>
<p>This photo is one of my favorites, it was taken on a clear night in september using my DSLR camera's 89x zoom feature. Of course the camera had to be stabilized on a tripod. There were no edits made to this picture. </p>
<p><img src="Moon1.JPG" width="700" height="500" alt=""/></p>
<p>This photo was taken very early in the morning, at approximately 5:00 A.M.. The sky appearing naturally blue on the image is the reason waking up so early was worth it. </p>
<p><img src="BlueMoon.JPG" width="700" height="500" alt=""/></p>
<p>This photo was taken at sunset while standing on the front porch of my grandma's house. The lack of air pollution in Avon, Colorado allows for extremely beautiful sunsets, ones that are best observed from one's own backyard. </p>

<p>This poem was written to convey love, and was written many years ago. I still enjoy it today, since the sentiment is the same, and everyone has that special person they can find safety in.</p></div>
