<h2>I hope that you enjoyed seeing a little bit about what makes me who I am, and for allowing me to utilize my web design skills while doing it. I had a lot of fun making the website and talking about myself and my interests.</h2>
<h2>I plan on finishing my English degree here at UNM by the spring semester of 2027, and then I plan to pursue my graduate degree in another school. I'm not entirely sure on where yet, but I defintely want to continue my schooling career. I have wanted to pursue programs in New York, California, Washington, West Virgina, Colorado and more. Any one of those Master's Degree programs will be more than sufficient in getting me the creative challenge I need to succeed, as well as the practice I need to hone my skills.</h2>
<h2>My goals as of now are to purely get paid to write somehow. In whatever form that takes, that'd fine with me. I want to finish my english degree and perhaps do some teaching, and follow a teacher's degree path. Alternatively, I also want to be a journalist, and going down the Communications degree path has also began to sound more appealing. Either way, as long as I can write, then I have everything I need.</h2>
