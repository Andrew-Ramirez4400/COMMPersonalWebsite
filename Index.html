  <h1 class="h1">HOME PAGE</h1><h1>Hello, my name is Andrew Ramirez, and what you're seeing here is my first attempt at a personal website. The site contains five pages and a lot of details about my life.</h1>
  <p>This site will serve as a collection of ideas and biography information about me, including some photography and some poetry. The poetry is taken over the span of three years, all on a Nikon Coolpix p900 DSLR camera, with minimal edits. The single poem included was written several years ago, but the themes within it still ring true. It is a love poem, written while in a state of being in love. </p>
  <p>Also in the website is a professional resume, containing my previous and current job history, my contact information, almost all of it electronic, and my educational history spanning my few notable schools of attendance in high school and college.</p>
  <h2>This website is the culmination of what I've learned in the class, and also is a great opportunity to showcase some interesting things about myself. I was able to take what I learned from each lesson in the class and apply it here in a functional way.</h2>
<p>I feel that I've come a long way since the beginning of the course, and this website being a reality is something I never thought I would accomplish, but here we are. Being able to express ones self in this format is very exciting, and I am glad for the opportunity. I hope you enjoy the site and find some of the things in it interesting like I do. Thank you for stopping by, and feel free to reach out about anything on the site at any time.</p>
