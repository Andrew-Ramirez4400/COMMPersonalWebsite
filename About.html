<div><h1 class="h1">ABOUT ME</h1>
<p>My name is Andrew Ramirez, and I'm a local of Colorado. I was born in Vail and raised in Avon, where I grew up in a modest home and fell in love with the arts. I remember being shown my first movies, and from the young age of 4 years old, I began to be affected by stories. Stories of fear, of happiness, or adventure or sorrow, all of them had me enthralled in thier glittering gaze. I grew up going to an elementary school that was across the street from where I lived. </p>
<p>I continued to live and work in Colorado into my teenage years, graduating from Battle Mountain High School with a scholarship to the local community college, Colorado Mountain College (CMC). I attended there until I got my Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in 2020. During this time I was working as a houseman in the housekeeping department in various local hotels, and soon after I was promoted to housekeeping supervisor. I initially intended to continue my schooling career until COVID hit and shut everything down, at which point I did not feel safe nor had the option of travelling, so I stayed back and continued to work and help support my grandma. </p>
<p>Many years later I resolved to move away from my hometown, and I quickly after moved to Denver, where I lived in various houses and apartments while working security at the Four Seasons hotel. I did little writing nor learning during this time, but it was still an important step toward growing and expanding my perspective. Eventually, the opportunity to leave Denver presented itself, so my girlfriend and I moved to Santa Fe for work. After being in Santa Fe for a few months, I knew that I needed to keep growing and challenging myself, which led me to restart my academic career at UNM. </p>
<p>Being a lover of stories and storytelling meant that I love all things art, and when I'm not studying or doing homework, you can find me reading, writing, drawing, painting, listening to music, watching movies, and playing video games. I hope to continue growing in my artisitic and intellectual endeavors, such as increasing my knowledge about computers and web design. </p>
